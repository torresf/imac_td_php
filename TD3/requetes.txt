## 1. SELECTIONS SIMPLES

# a.
SELECT * 
FROM cast;

# b.
SELECT * 
FROM cast 
WHERE deathYear IS NULL;

# c.
SELECT * 
FROM cast
WHERE deathYear IS NULL 
  AND birthYear < YEAR(NOW()) - 65;

# d.
SELECT * 
FROM cast
WHERE deathYear IS NULL 
ORDER BY birthYear
LIMIT 1;

# e.
SELECT * 
FROM cast
WHERE YEAR(NOW()) - birthYear BETWEEN 30 AND 50
ORDER BY (YEAR(NOW()) - birthYear) DESC;

# f.
SELECT * 
FROM movie
WHERE title LIKE "%the%";



## 2. JOINTURES

# a.
SELECT title, releaseDate 
FROM movie 
WHERE idCountry = "USA"
ORDER BY releaseDate DESC;

# b.
SELECT title, releaseDate, name
FROM movie 
INNER JOIN country ON country.code = movie.idCountry
WHERE idCountry = "USA"
	AND YEAR(releaseDate) >= YEAR(NOW()) - 10  
ORDER BY releaseDate;

# c.
SELECT movie.title AS Titre, genre.name AS Genre
FROM movie 
INNER JOIN moviegenre ON moviegenre.idMovie = movie.id
INNER JOIN genre ON genre.id = moviegenre.idGenre
WHERE idCountry IN ("USA", "IT")
	AND YEAR(releaseDate) <= YEAR(NOW()) - 20;

# d.
SELECT DISTINCT cast.firstname, cast.lastname
FROM movie m
INNER JOIN actor a ON m.id = a.idMovie
INNER JOIN cast ON a.idActor = cast.id
ORDER BY lastname, firstname;

# e.
SELECT m.title AS Titre, g.name AS Genre, a.name AS "Rôle"
FROM genre g, movie m, actor a, cast c, moviegenre
WHERE m.id = a.idMovie
	AND m.idCountry = "FR"
	AND CONCAT(c.firstname, " ", c.lastname) = "Élodie Deshayes"
	AND a.idActor = c.id
	AND m.id = moviegenre.idMovie
	AND moviegenre.idGenre = g.id;

# f.
SELECT c.firstname AS "Prénom", c.lastname AS "Nom", a.name AS "Rôle"
FROM movie m, actor a, cast c, director d
WHERE d.idDirector = (SELECT id FROM cast WHERE CONCAT(cast.firstname, " ", cast.lastname) = "Myriam Anik")
	AND d.idMovie = m.id
	AND a.idMovie = m.id
	AND a.idActor = c.id
ORDER BY a.name;



## 3. REQUETES COMPLEXES

# a.
SELECT g.name AS Genre, COUNT(*) AS "Nombre de films"
FROM movie m
INNER JOIN moviegenre mg ON mg.idMovie = m.id
INNER JOIN genre g ON g.id = mg.idGenre
GROUP BY g.name;

# b.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Nb Films avec Voix Off"
FROM actor
WHERE actor.name = "Voix Off";

# c.
SELECT c.firstname AS "Prénom", c.lastname AS "Nom"
FROM cast c, actor a
WHERE c.id = a.idActor
	AND (a.name = "Développeur" OR a.name = "Développeuse");

# d.
SELECT m.title as Titre
FROM movie m, director d
WHERE m.id = d.idMovie
GROUP BY m.title
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

# e.
SELECT m.title as Titre, g.name AS Genre, country.name as Pays, m.releaseDate AS "Date de Sortie", CONCAT(cast.firstname, " ", cast.lastname) AS "Prénom Nom"
FROM movie m, genre g, country, moviegenre, cast, director d
WHERE country.code IN ("USA", "IT", "FR")
	AND m.idCountry = country.code
	AND g.name IN ("Action", "Drama", "Comedy", "Western")
	AND g.id = moviegenre.idGenre
	AND m.id = moviegenre.idMovie
	AND m.title LIKE "%a%"
	AND DATE(m.releaseDate) BETWEEN DATE("2000-01-01") AND NOW()
	AND cast.id = d.idDirector
	AND d.idMovie = m.id
	AND CONCAT(cast.firstname, " ", cast.lastname) LIKE "%o%";
